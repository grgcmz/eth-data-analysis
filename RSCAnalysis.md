```

Methods used

- 0x095ea7b3 is the approve method of ERC-20
  - approve(address spender, uint256 amount) → bool
  - Source: https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/token/erc20#IERC20-Transfer-address-address-uint256-
- 0xa9059cbb is the transfer method of ERC-20

  - Source: https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/token/erc20#IERC20-approve-address-uint256-


##### ERC-20 functions and parameters

###### Example for 0xa9059cbb (transfer)

```
select  hash, substr(method_id,1,64) as method, substr(method_parameters,1) as parameters
from 	f_blockchain fb 
		inner join d_transaction dt on fb.transaction_id = dt.transaction_id 
where 	to_address = '0xd101dcc414f310268c37eeb4cd376ccfa507f571';
```

```
0x135cfbf83302438aad8949cb4916d3c84aadbe1176b86d8f40cdaed2dd186001	0xa9059cbb	000000000000000000000000e34eaba455a7aec993a3d750c9c9c8750bc5df2d0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000022eb3f35a25b1a100000
```

Result:

- Transaction hash 0x135cfbf83302438aad8949cb4916d3c84aadbe1176b86d8f40cdaed2dd186001
- Method ID 0xa9059cbb
- Parameter 1: 000000000000000000000000e34eaba455a7aec993a3d750c9c9c8750bc5df2d
  - To address 0xe34eaba455a7aec993a3d750c9c9c8750bc5df2d
  - Address of an RSC account holder
- Parameter 2: 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000022eb3f35a25b1a100000
  - Amount 22eb3f35a25b1a100000_16
  - RSC contract is configured with 18 decimal places
  - Conversion:  Amount_16 /10^18 
    - 22EB3F35A25B1A100000_16 = 164900000000000000000000 / 10^18 = 164900

###### Token swap transactions

For exchanges between RSC and other coins or tokens to occur, the account holder sends an approve transaction to the RSC contract with the exchange smart contract address as *spender* parameter:

> Transaction with method 0x095ea7b3 (approve)

```
select  hash, block_number, from_address, 
		substr(method_id,1,64) as method, substr(method_parameters,1) as parameters
from 	f_blockchain fb 
		inner join d_transaction dt on fb.transaction_id = dt.transaction_id 
where 	to_address = '0xd101dcc414f310268c37eeb4cd376ccfa507f571'
and     method_id  = '0x095ea7b3';
```

```

  - Spender address 0x7a250d5630b4cf539739df2c5dacb4c659f2488d
  - Well-known address of Uniswap decentralized exchange
- Parameter 2: ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
  - Approval of an unlimited amount for future token exchanges through uniswap



Secondly, the account holder sends a transaction to the exchange smart contract, any time after the approval transaction. This transaction is the token exchange with parameters such as the amount in *amountIn*, the *to* address where to send the exchanged tokens, and a *path* which is an array of multiple addresses of ERC-20 smart contracts. Each pair of addresses specifies an exchange.
